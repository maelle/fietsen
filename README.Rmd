 Finding cycle paths and tracks in 7 cities
=====================================================
  
In this repo I store the code I used for finding cycle paths and tracks in 7 cities.

* I have defined [a bunch of functions](code/utils.R) for making the Overpass queries and computing distances or numbers of given nodes.

* The whole process is described in [a sort of make file](makefile.R).

* Initial shapefiles for cities were prepared as [shown here](code/make_initial_shapefile.R). For some cities it simply involved queries to GADM, for other I had to use shapefiles from official sources in the country. This data is not included in the repository.

* I prepared a data frame with cities shapefiles and minimal and maximal latitude and longitude [in this file](code/make_shapefiles.R). The queries to Overpass are done for a rectangle defined with minimal and maximal latitude and longitude and then I filtered results within the city boundaries.

* I prepared the query strings [in this code](code/make_query_strings.R).

* I made the queries and calculations [here](code/make_overpass_queries.R). The results are [in this file with a stupid name](tadaaa.csv).

* I also produced a few maps thanks to [this code](code/make_maps.R) The maps are in the [maps folder](maps/).
